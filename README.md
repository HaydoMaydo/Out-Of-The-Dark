# Out of the Dark
## Description
Find your way out. Any means necessary. Play the default levels found in /levels, or create your own with the built in maze editor. More information can be found in the Official Player Guide found in the root directory. 

## Before you run the game
Please note that there is a Python 3.6+ dependency. This game requires that the tkinter library for Python is installed (it is installed by default), and that the location of Python is added as an environment variable. This is needed because the C++ files invocate a Python script by doing a system call similar to  `system("Python path/to/pyFile.py arg1 arg2")`

## Running the game
### Windows
1. Navigate to the windows-binary subdirectory
2. Launch the game by opening main.exe.
3. Enjoy the game!

### Linux/Mac
1. You will have to compile all .cpp files in /src and run it yourself.
2. If you are unsure on how to do this, look up videos on installing SFML and compiling SFML projects on Linux/Mac
