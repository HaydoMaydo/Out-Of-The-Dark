Small Additions:

3.  dont use random numbers, use constants with variable names throughout code
4.  get rid of new/delete and make smart pointers throughout code
5.  follow the rule of 5/0 design for constructor destructor copy constructor move ....
6.  "You have personal information in filename.txt, if you have secrets like 
    passwords or personal information, they should be in uncommitted settings files
    that the user is instructed to create, or in environment variables the user is
    asked to set up."
